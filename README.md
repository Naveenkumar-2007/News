# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning + FastAPI

This project predicts whether a news article is **Real** or **Fake** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.  
It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment** with a **FastAPI** REST API.

## 🚀 Features  

- ✅ Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopwords removal, lemmatization, HTML & link removal)  
- ✅ Different vectorization techniques tested:  
  - **CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression** → **Accuracy: 98.6%** 🎯  
  - **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** → **Accuracy: 96.4%**  
  - **Word2Vec + Logistic Regression** → **Accuracy: 72.8%**  
- ✅ Final deployed model: **CountVectorizer + Logistic Regression**  
- ✅ FastAPI for real-time predictions (`/predict` endpoint)  
- ✅ REST API accepts raw text and returns prediction as **Real News** or **Fake News**

## 📊 Dataset  

The dataset consists of **real news** and **fake news** articles.  

- `data/real` → Real news articles → labeled as **1**  
- `data/Fack` → Fake news articles → labeled as **0**  

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing Steps  

1. Lowercasing text  
2. Removing special characters  
3. Removing HTML tags & links  
4. Removing stopwords  
5. Lemmatization (WordNet)  
6. Removing extra spaces
